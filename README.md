## Summary

The objective of this project is to provide you with practical examples of how to manipulate the DOM. The functionalities used in this project serve two purposes: to help you learn how to add dynamically generated data to the DOM and to demonstrate how JavaScript can enhance the user experience of a static website. Although this project only scratches the surface of what is possible, it utilizes some very common events, methods, and logic.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Project description

The website is divided into four main sections: Hiking, Camping, Wildlife, and Gear. Each section features articles, guides, and photos that offer practical tips, advice, and inspiration for anyone interested in that particular aspect of outdoor exploration. For example, the Hiking section might include guides to popular hiking trails, safety tips, and advice on gear and equipment, while the Wildlife section might feature articles on birdwatching, animal tracking, and conservation efforts.
